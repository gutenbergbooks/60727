  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>At Bayeux in Normandy, a little town as old perhaps
as our race and older certainly than our records and
our religion, there is to be seen in the main room of
what was once the Bishop’s Palace a document unique
in Europe. There is no other example, I think, of
a record, contemporary or nearly contemporary, of an
event so remote in the story of Christendom, detailed
upon so considerable a scale and relating to a matter of
such moment. It is these three characters combined
which give to the Bayeux Tapestry its value. We have,
indeed, pictorial representation more accurate and more
detailed in some few cases, but relating to the periods
when material civilisation was high—before the Dark
Ages. We have again an ample store of evidence
pictorial and written, relating to the vivid life of the
earlier Middle Ages, and of course, an overwhelming
mass of matter dealing with everything that accompanied
or has succeeded the Renaissance. Even of the Dark
Ages and of that violent and happy transition from the
Dark Ages to Mediæval civilisation, we have here and
there sharp pictures—mostly pictures of the pen and
not of the pencil. But these pictures relate—almost
always—episodes which were not the capital episodes of
their time. The Bayeux Tapestry stands quite apart in
this: that it represents so faithfully and so thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>one of the half-dozen acts essential to the remaking of
Europe, and that it so represents an act which, on the
analogy of every other of that early time, we should
expect to receive only from a short and doubtful literary
account. It is the one picture we have of any magnitude
showing us the things of the Crusading turning-point.
For Western Christendom, as we know, awoke
from its sleep and flowered into the Middle Ages through
three great efforts: The Norman Adventures, the Reform
of the Church under St. Gregory VII, and the
Crusading March. All these were the product of a sort
of spring which came upon our ancestry more than
eight hundred years ago, and which restored in a
renewed form the civilisation of the West. Of that
spring the Bayeux Tapestry remains the one piece of
ocular description which has survived.</p>
<p class='c006'>Unfortunately, there must be added to this statement
(which would be final if we could be certain of
our dates) a critical warning. The date of the work is
not certain. I will set forth in a moment the arguments
which have been put forward for fixing the work to this
or to that moment. We can happily be certain beyond
reasonable doubt that it was produced within the lifetime
of men who could remember the Invaders of
England. It is not later than that. It has even been
believed to be actually contemporary with the Invasion
itself, and produced under the direction of those who
took part in the expedition. But though it is virtually
a contemporary document, even if we find ourselves
compelled to accept the lower of these limits, yet we
unfortunately have not a definite proof of the year or
years in which the work was finished. This is the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>point which mars our satisfaction in our possession of
this thing. It is here worthy of curious remark that
the history of the English is singularly fortunate in the
wealth of record which it has at call. No other nation
has such an accumulation of ancient testimony to hand.
No other nation has such a document as the <i>Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle</i> or as the <i>Doomsday Survey</i>, and, by an
accident both of civil and of religious history, no other
nation has preserved through the revolutions of a thousand
years so much material record undestroyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>When a man first sees the Tapestry at Bayeux his
immediate impression and his most vivid one is the
impression occasionally, but rarely, produced by some
perfect architectural relic—an impression of liveliness
as though time had been telescoped up for his advantage.
I say that this impression is rare, but when we do get
it, it is violent. You feel it in the “immortal marble
undecayed” of a portrait bust of the Mediterranean; in
the sharp colouring of the funereal inscriptions of Constantine;
in the flagstones and the columns of the
Forum at Timgad. It is exceedingly difficult to convey
in language this shock which the eye receives when
centuries seem to drop out and the action of men to be
brought up from the remote past to the present as an
object is brought up from the remote distance to the
foreground through the action of a lens. I can best
compare it to the shock which the mind receives upon
hearing after many years, and long after it has been
thought forgotten, a familiar voice; or to that similar
arrest that our whole being suffers when we smell some
smell which went with a whole experience of youth.
I say it is very rarely that a surviving monument of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>remote past will give this shock. Most antique material
things carry deeply bitten into them the evidences of
decay. But now and then (the Gospel of St. Chad at
Lichfield occurs to me as I write) you get freshness and,
as it were, companionship from something which belongs
to the dead, who have been dead so long that the very
style of their lives has vanished. All this you get when
you first see the canvas at Bayeux.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must next be clearly understood in what convention
and with what purpose those who made this
embroidery worked.</p>

<p class='c006'>The object of all this kind of work in every age
where it has flourished (and such ages cover nearly the
whole of human history) is to establish a <i>record.</i> The
motive is “lest the deeds of those great men, our fathers,
should perish.” Now, there are a hundred ways of
satisfying that motive more or less. The one that
first occurs to us to-day is of course Inscription. But
Inscription suffers from two faults: first, it is not
universal; secondly, it is jejune.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not universal, because the written characters
and the language which they express cannot be
universal. They may be lost, or they may become
provincial and neglected. It is jejune because full
experience is not to be crowded into even an excess
of words. You will find in Normandy (not a day’s walk
from Bayeux, by the way) a very long inscription to a
local personage of the third century. It is in Latin—that
is, in the most universal of literary mediums—and
yet it has served principally for the quarrels of archæologists.
There is no prime term in any early inscription
that will not serve for such a quarrel, simply because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>language is an imperfect symbol. You are pleased to
understand to-day the inscription upon a bronze tablet
let into the wall of a public building and thus inscribed:</p>
<p class='c007'>“<i>This Foundation Stone was laid by the Rev. Charles
Woodle, M.A., on the occasion of the Second Jubilee of Her
Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.</i>”</p>
<p class='c005'>You understand what it means. A few centuries hence
(if the language has survived), one determining symbol
after another will be a matter of dispute. Men will
be arguing what “Rev.” means, what “M.A.”; perhaps
what “Jubilee,” what “Gracious”—and all the
rest of it. The word “Foundation” will give them
a good deal of trouble.</p>
<p class='c006'>What is the alternative? If record by verbal symbol
is so imperfect and if all symbol must be sensual, what
other sense can we approach? Humanity has never
made anything of the symbolism of music, and never
will. It is not fixed. There remain only the eye and
the picture meant for the eye. Now in a picture,
however rude or however perfect, whether in the flat
or the round, you get the most permanent record. All
humanity except our time has understood that. The
appeal to the eye is at once the most universal, and can
be with the least expense of effort the most detailed.
Our own time will probably suffer more through the
neglect of this than through any other of our neglects,
and posterity will ignore us most through our lack
of pictorial symbol. It does not tell a future age
anything to paint a picture of cows at a ford. It
tells a future age very little to paint a picture of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Coronation, but to make a bas-relief of one policeman
holding up one motor-bus, one man selling newspapers
to one other man, and so on, all along a frieze, would
be to leave a record of London, and a record which
would be independent of the vitality of alphabets and
idioms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, this kind of record demands a Convention;
in other words, it must be symbolic much more than
it is mimetic, and that is the note you get in the work
preserved at Bayeux. Not the reproduction of things
seen, but the perpetuation of their ideas: a few figures
standing for a host: an emblem defining a man: an
episode noticed to its simplest terms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now as to the authenticity of, or to be more accurate
the date of, this famous document. The more slipshod,
earlier, and picturesque historians, with their touch of
charlatanism and their eye upon the public (notably
Freeman), naturally desired to believe, and even more
naturally said, that the embroidery now preserved at
Bayeux was exactly contemporary with the Conquest.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must not include in our criticism or our blame
such men as Napoleon, who, after all, did not pronounce
himself, but took what he was told; nor men not professedly
historians who carried on the tradition that the
work came from the needle of William the Conqueror’s
wife and her ladies. An unhistorical statement proceeding
from one who does not profess acquaintance with
the bases of history cannot be seriously criticised. But,
as the legend that the Bayeux embroidery is actually
contemporary with the Invasion of England has been
erected into a sort of University dogma and propagated
through English schools and text-books, it is as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>to point out to my readers the nature of this simple
error.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Battle of Hastings was fought on the 14th of
October 1066. The Bayeux Tapestry is later than the
First Crusade, the climax of which campaign was the
capture of Jerusalem on July 15, 1099.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is as certainly later than the First Crusade as a
picture of a man in trousers and a top-hat is later than
the French Revolution. How much later it is than the
First Crusade we cannot yet say, and perhaps will never
be able to say. We can say (just as we can say about
the gentleman in the trousers and the top-hat) that it
is quite appreciably later than the turning-point in
history chosen for our fixed date of change. It was
the French Revolution which disturbed, woke up, rearranged
society. Attaching to that big business any
number of external expressions may be discovered—quasi-democratic
parliaments, the modern post-office,
conscript armies, &amp;c. &amp;c., but the historical date is
1789-1795. One of the products or marks of the
change is the change in costume. Even an expert in
the distant future might be puzzled to tell you whether
the engraving of a man in trousers and a top-hat was
twenty or thirty or forty or fifty years later than 1795.
But he could be absolutely certain if a proper knowledge
of the past had survived that it was <i>some few years</i>, say
ten or fifteen years, or, even better, twenty years later
than the conclusion of the Revolutionary upheaval.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, so it is with the Bayeux Tapestry and the
First Crusade.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dates of the First Crusade are 1096-99. It
was accomplished from thirty to thirty-three years after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>the Battle of Hastings. William was dead some time;
men who, as boys, had deployed upon Telham Hill, and
charged up the slope of battle were grizzled, were
between fifty and sixty, when that squire from Sourdeval
first leapt upon the wall of Jerusalem. But the effect of
a great change, its external effect in habiliment and the
rest, takes some few years to work, and early as we may
put the Bayeux Tapestry, we cannot put it earlier than
a date in which men who may in youth have seen the
fight at Hastings were certainly old, even if they survived
to give their testimony.</p>

<p class='c006'>In rough figures, there must be an interval of at
least fifty years. It is more probable that the interval
was of greater length than that—but fifty years is the
minimum.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me briefly lay before the reader the evidence
upon which this decision must be accepted. I will
enter into no one of the many—I had almost said innumerable—doubtful
details. I will not even linger
upon one part of the evidence, which is very striking—the
fact that the length of the Tapestry exactly coincides
with the contour of the nave of Bayeux Cathedral, upon
which it was annually hung. And my reason for not
pressing this point is that we have no definite evidence
upon the date of the nave of Bayeux. Let me make
myself clear. We know, of course, that the Gothic is
roughly the product of the Crusades. We know that
the Romanesque is roughly the pre-Crusade architecture.
A man has but to see the interior of Bayeux Cathedral
(as I did at Mass three or four months ago during my
inspection of this document) to see that that nave is
a product of the Transition. But short of documents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>telling us exactly when the ground plan of the nave
was drawn up, we cannot establish a date within fifty
years. What adds to our ignorance is the fact that
your later work was nearly always and throughout
Europe modelled upon your earlier work. Consider,
for instance, all the discussion with regard to the extension
of the western end of Chartres; or consider
the massive Romanesque foundation and pillars of Notre
Dame in Paris, with its Gothic superstructure; consider
the accident by which we owe the Gothic unity of
that monument to the fire which happened to destroy
in 1218 the original Romanesque apse. Had evidence of
dates not survived in the case of Notre Dame we might
be out by anything between fifty and seventy years.</p>

<p class='c006'>So with Bayeux. The correspondence of the length
of the Tapestry to the length of the nave proves that
the Tapestry was at least not earlier than the nave,
but we do not know that the nave may not have
been of just that length <i>before</i> some process of rebuilding.</p>

<p class='c006'>No; the evidence that the Bayeux Tapestry is later
than the Battle of Hastings and the reign of William the
Conqueror is of a simpler and more conclusive kind, and
resides in the idea the artist had of men’s accoutrements—dress
and arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me detail these.</p>

<p class='c006'>First, Edward the Confessor bears a crown marked
by the fleur-de-lis. Now the fleur-de-lis thus marked
upon the crown is a matter of the twelfth century, not
of the eleventh—just as is the oriflamme. The sceptre, if
we may judge by the seals and manuscripts (which with
very rare sculptural examples are our sole evidence), is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>twelfth-century and not an eleventh-century sceptre.
This note on costume is true even down to the details
of the shoes upon the feet; they are the shoes of the
middle of the twelfth, not of the end of the eleventh
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now turn to something upon a larger line, though
not more conclusive: the adornment of the shield.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am here upon very vague ground, and I know it.
But I think that ground, though vague, has limits
inferior and superior. The custom of adorning the
shield with distinctive marks which might be recognised
in battle, is of course as old as the world—or at
least as old as the profession of arms. But something
ritual and regular attaching to this habit, something
which made it part of society and a wheel within the
machinery almost of law and certainly of social habit, is
the creation of the Crusades.</p>

<p class='c006'>A modern parallel will make my point clear. A
cheque is something belonging to the nineteenth century,
especially the latter part of the nineteenth century.
Orders for payments signed in various ways are very
much older. But a cheque is a cheque. It is something
crystallised and developed in what is now a fixed
and a final form. So with armorial bearings. Bring
me some new document which shows that Charlemagne
himself had the sun or the moon painted upon his shield,
and I shall not be surprised; but I do know that the
<i>regular</i> portraiture of such and such emblems to represent
such and such people, and the <i>common</i> habit among great
families of always having such, is posterior to and not
prior to the Crusading march: it was indeed, in the
main, a product of the Crusading march.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>Now, the Bayeux Tapestry, though it shows us most
of the shields without such signs (for most of them were
the shields of common knights), yet shows the shields of
leaders regularly adorned with distinctive bearings; note,
for instance, the four lords who come from Guy of
Ponthieu to take Harold prisoner. Each of these shields
carries an armorial bearing. The two heralds or messengers,
men presumably of position, who ride to tell
William the overlord that Guy has captured Harold, are
similarly distinguished. Those in the immediate suite
of the sovereigns or quasi-sovereigns show the mark, as
when Harold is interviewed by William. One principal
shield is hung upon the first two ships of those which
sail for England for the Conquest, and each has armorial
bearings. Nor need the reader be surprised at the
number of shields which have none, if he will consider
how large a proportion are seen in reverse—that is, from
the inside—the side where the shield was held by the
arm, the side which was turned towards the body. For
where the artist describing a fight shows us the right
arm with its weapon, and therefore the left arm holding
the shield from within, he cannot let us know whether
the shield was ornamented or no. But turn to the
scenes where the fight is upon the defensive, as, for
instance, that showing Harold’s resistance to the Norman
charge, there you at once get the leaders with their
pictured shields marking the distinction of rank; or
again, where the Norman charge in the next panel is
shown getting home into the Saxon axes—there you
have two shields out of five distinctively ornamented. In
the episode of the death of the brothers of Harold, all
the three shields that appear have some mark. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>is no need to labour the point, nor even to point out the
elaborate design upon one of the shields portrayed in
the pursuit of the defeated army.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident that we are dealing with a work produced
at a time when it was thought normal that any
man of distinction should carry his mark upon his shield,
and, I repeat, to think that normal was the state of
mind of the middle twelfth century at earliest and not
of the mid-eleventh century at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is just one good argument and only one for
the contemporary character of the document; that
argument is the argument from tradition. It is an
argument to which I shall always offer the greatest
reverence, particularly as it has been particularly despised
by the superficial but popular University historians of
the last century. Tradition is certainly the binding
element in social memory, and if one could discover
an active tradition that the embroidery of Bayeux had
been made by the wives of those who fought at Hastings,
though existing evidence not traditional would compel
us to reject that tradition in its absolute form, yet it
would be our duty to consider closely how the tradition
arose and what it might mean—for instance, it might mean
that the existing work was the adaptation of an earlier
work. But, as a fact, the tradition is not old. It was not
of popular but of academic, and therefore of worthless,
origin. The later Middle Ages seem to have known
nothing of it; the Chapter of the Cathedral, which was
the conservator of the document, bears no testimony of
the sort. To call the Bayeux Tapestry “Queen Matilda’s
Tapestry” seems to have been nothing but the guesswork
of an antiquarian don. Let us leave it at that.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Another evidence of date is the fact (to which I
shall make continual allusion in the text) that the
Bayeux Tapestry follows fairly closely the <i>Roman de
Rou</i>, Wace’s poem describing the Conquest; and that
poem cannot be earlier than the middle of the twelfth
century—it is usually put as late as the last third of
the twelfth. Not only is Wace followed, but certain
other authorities which help to date the production.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this would be quite conclusive but for one
rebutting argument, the value of which I leave to the
judgment of the reader. The written sources which
the Tapestry appears to follow would repose upon
certain common traditions, memories, and earlier documents,
and the Tapestry might be imagined to repose
upon the same. But the general rule in tracing the
sources of human work of this sort is that the written
account precedes the pictorial and serves as a basis
for it, while the convergence of this evidence with the
evidence of accoutrements and dress leaves little doubt.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have in the Bayeux Tapestry something certainly
later than 1140,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a> almost certainly later than 1150, probably
as late as 1160, but, on the other hand, certainly
prior to the date 1200.</p>

<div class='footnote c009' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The bier of Edward the Confessor is designed in the twelfth
century fashion, not in the eleventh—the long vestment of the royal
personages throughout is a twelfth-century not an eleventh-century type.
The description of the coat of mail in Wace (verses 6522 and the following)
is that of the Tapestry; and most important of all the coat of mail
of the Tapestry is no longer the mere breastplate, but the full coat of the
Crusading period.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is true that we have very little information upon the eleventh
century armour, but with the Crusades we do get a full description,
and we have a right to judge by what we know rather than by what
we do not know. Thus Ordericus Vitalis remarks the full coat as a
novelty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The helmet with a nasal is not now in any document before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>seal of Baldwin, the late 1115, but after that date it is common, as one
may see in the seal of Charles of Flanders or of Matthew of Montmorency.
Indeed, the seal of William the Conqueror himself gives no sign of the
nasal, and the same is true of the seals of the First Crusade. This kind
of helmet is wholly twelfth century; but remark that William, in the
Chronicles, lifted his helmet to show his face. So there is here doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many of our historians carelessly talk of Harold being brought to Rouen.
We have no proof of this. There is just one allusion in the Chronicles to the
place where delivery of Harold’s body was made from Guy to William, and the
place mentioned is what we should expect, a frontier town, Eu. The Palatium
does not only mean a <i>place</i>, it also means an <i>institution</i>; and though Rouen was
William’s chief city, whenever he moved, his clerks and staff of government—that
is, his “Palatium”—moved with him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. Oman in his version of the affair makes Bonneville the scene of the
oath. I have not seen the proof of this. The two fundamental pieces of evidence—Wace
and the Tapestry—both say Bayeux. William had a castle above the
river Touques at Bonneville, and ruins of it, or of a later construction upon its
site, can be seen to-day; but it is a good two days’ march from Bayeux.</p>

<p class='c010'>The French word “parliament” meant, of course, any general assembly for discussion,
and was here used of something earlier than any representative assembly,
though these were already springing up in the Spanish March of the Pyrenees, to
which district we owe the origin of representative institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first three sections of the Bayeux Tapestry must be taken together,
for they describe one incident, which is the departure of Harold from Bosham
the port of Chichester, and a manor of his own. Of strictly contemporary
evidence to that journey we have none. We can only guess that the year
in which it was taken was the year 1064. As to its motive the Bayeux
Tapestry gives of course the current Norman version, or rather hints at it.
Edward the Confessor is in his palace at Westminster. It is important to
note the conventional signs of his rank, the sceptre and the crown. It is the
reappearance of the same symbols in the crowning of Harold—which was in
the Norman version his supreme act of treason—that is particularly insisted
upon. Edward, thus officially presented as it were, is giving a message: that
is certainly the symbolism of the attitude, and it is exceedingly likely, though
not equally certain, that the person to whom the message is being given is
intended for Harold. But it is remarkable that the inscription here says
nothing of the nature of that message, and that the point of capital importance—William
of Malmesbury’s assertion that Harold was sent by Edward to
assure William of his succession to the English throne—is not set out.
Taking Wace as the basis of the Tapestry—and this is the best hypothesis—Harold
sailed to release from William’s custody his brother Wulfnoth, who
had been kept as a hostage in Normandy for King Edward to guarantee
King Edward the fidelity of Godwin. But we must remember that the
<i>Roman de Rou</i> does mention Edward’s sending Harold to assure William of
the succession. And on the whole it is most likely that the intention of the
Tapestry is to suggest this. Harold and his knights ride to Bosham. Harold
himself is conventionally distinguished by the hawk on the wrist. The Church
of Bosham is introduced into the story probably or certainly with the object
of emphasizing (as the Tapestry perpetually does) the religious enormity of
Harold’s later action, and both this visit to the Church and the Feast in the
Upper Room before embarking, which forms the fourth episode, are clearly
intended to refer to incidents which were traditional in the Norman story.
But we have, I think, no remaining text giving either the visit to the Church
or the Feast.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In the <a href='#i05'>fifth division</a> Harold and his suite embark, and it should be noted
how large a company the Convention of the Tapestry supposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The intention of the expedition was almost certainly to make a Norman
port. Once in the Channel the square-rigged ships could not beat into a
wind that was too westerly for them or too much south of west, and their
land-fall was at some point upon the coast of Ponthieu, of which district
Count Guy was the lord. The point upon the coast of Ponthieu where the
ships beached, or rather cast anchor in the shoal water, we may presume to
have been the right bank of the estuary of the Somme, for it is the most
convenient entry and has some shelter from a southerly wind; but all that flat
sandy coast gave good opportunity for landing from such vessels, and the
fleet may have made the Bay of Authie or even the mouth of the Canche.
But the choice is not a wide one, for the coast of Ponthieu did not extend
beyond the Canche. If the Somme were the point of entry, it has this
historical interest: that Harold would then have found himself fated to land
at the very point from which William two years later was to sail for the
invasion of England. Count Guy seized Harold for ransom, something of a
formality, though a formality which was to be of formidable consequence.
He takes Harold and his suite to “Belrem”—the place to-day called Beaurain.
Here the Tapestry follows Wace very closely, for it is Wace who tells us
that Harold was recognised by a fisherman, who sent for Count Guy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The capital of Ponthieu was Montreuil, and this castle of Beaurain, of
which ruins still stand, was six or seven miles up the river from Montreuil—one
passes right beneath it in the railway to-day on one’s way to Hesdin.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The last scene in this episode (which ends the first part of the story) is a
scene by night in the hall of the castle of Beaurain, where by the light of
torches Count Guy and Harold (who have ridden to Beaurain together as men
of equal rank though one is being held to ransom) are bargaining—for the
word “Parobolant” must refer to the discussion of the ransom.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this first series of episodes in the story succeeds the arrival of the
Duke of Normandy’s heralds insisting upon the release of Harold because
Guy was vassal to William. The advent of these messengers forms the
<a href='#i12'>12th</a> and <a href='#i13'>13th</a> sections of the design. It is perhaps a guide to the time
of year in which all this took place, that on the border below we have the
ploughing and the sowing of the spring. There has arisen in connection with
these messengers of William’s a considerable and rather futile debate as to the
meaning of the little figure who is holding the horses. I take his small size
to be merely a piece of perspective, and the word “Turold” to refer to the
taller figure on the left, to which it is attached.</p>

<p class='c006'>This name Turold will be familiar to the students of Normandy in
another famous connection, for it was a Turold (much at this time) who put
at the end of “The Song of Roland” his inscription: “This is the end of
what Turoldus wrote.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>After the arrival of the messengers the next three panels deal with Guy’s
reluctant submission to his overlord; then comes the handing over of Harold
to William. The Tapestry here closely follows Wace, save in one odd
particular—that it reverses the order of the scenes and does not make quite
clear the insistence of William; at least, that insistence and the importance of
the urgent orders which William sent are not evident to a modern man looking
at the document. But there is an element which might have made it
clearer to a contemporary, and this is the accoutrement of the messengers. I
have spoken about this in another aspect in the Preface. They are presumably
men of high position in William’s court, for they bear fully developed
heraldic signs upon their shield. It should be remarked, however, that save
for shield and lance they are not armoured, and whether to indicate haste or
the pacific character which William designed to retain as long as possible in
their mission, they are not even helmeted. There is another point in these
panels well worth the attention of the modern reader interested in the date
of the document. We have in the border beneath an episode of a man fighting
a bear, and somewhat to the right an episode which <i>may</i> be the introduction
of tropical animals—the larger Felidæ, panthers perhaps. The first subject
is certain, the second probable. Now, here (with many other examples in
the long border above and below) you have the influence of the <i>bestiaries</i> (that
is, the twelfth-century books describing beasts foreign and imaginary), and
these, in turn, are the product of the Crusading march. In other words,
these details fit in with all the rest of the converging evidence which forbids
us to doubt that the document is of a later date than the Conquest itself.
The last of this group of panels, the 16th, represents the bringing of
Harold to William by Guy, and there follows a most interesting group of
not less than ten panels, which form a separate episode in the story, and one
which is for many reasons of high historic interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>This episode is that of the Breton War, and it is curious to note that the
rude though vigorous work of the Bayeux Tapestry tells us more about it
than any other authority. The importance of this contrast between the
Tapestry and the chroniclers will be at once apparent. It means that some
tradition or some lost document ascribed to this somewhat inconclusive expedition
into Brittany holds a great place in the story of Harold and his relations
with the Conqueror. No one who looks at the Tapestry can doubt for a
moment what the point of this episode is. The point is that Harold, joining
with William in the expedition, proving of great service, rewarded by William,
and in general much more closely bound to the Norman court through this
accident than he otherwise might have been, was in all that followed a
treacherous <i>friend</i>. The implication is clear. Whoever designed the Tapestry,
or furnished the materials from tradition, believed and wanted others to believe
that Harold was not only formally a traitor according to the mere rules
of feudal society, but also morally and fundamentally one, as having forgotten
and abused a close personal tie, the product of armed service. It is evident
that in the imagination of contemporaries, and therefore in the tradition
which they built up, this march of Harold side by side with William into
Brittany colours the whole story.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wace has but a few vague lines just telling us that there was such a
thing as a fight with Brittany at this moment. If I am not mistaken,
William of Poitiers is the only chronicler who gives us anything like an
account, and even so his account is absurdly short and undetailed, though
it tallies, both as to the places mentioned and as to the episodes with the
Tapestry. The Breton Chronicle, I believe, says nothing about it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Turning to the details of these ten panels (<a href='#i17'>17</a> to <a href='#i26'>26</a> inclusive), one notes
again the fully developed armorial bearings upon the retinue of William, and
in the next panel the convention of the Palatium,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> that capital institution of
Europe, the seat of government in every land; in one aspect a building, in
another a body of men, and throughout the West for a thousand years the
continuator of Rome.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is also interesting to note the attempt at portraiture in the case of
William. The round bullet head and square shoulders of the Gaul (the
slight and distant strain of Scandinavian blood seems to have influenced
neither his soul nor his body) are emphasized in this first introduction of him,
and it is possible so to emphasize the portrait because he is so represented in
this early part of the series neither helmeted nor crowned.</p>

<p class='c006'>The episode of the priest and of the woman who is given the name of
“Aelfgyva” has, if I am not mistaken, remained quite inexplicable. I will
not follow my predecessors in the criticism of this, for I can suggest nothing
new with regard to it. All who have written on the Tapestry with any care
for historical accuracy and for the spirit of research have admitted their incompetence
to explain the thing. There follows upon it the riding out of
the army across the neck of the Cotentin towards the Mont St. Michael,
which was, as it were, the boundary stone between Brittany and Normandy;
and here we have the first appearance of those knights in full armour, which
are so characteristic of the chief episodes in the Tapestry and whose costume
is of such value to us in estimating its date. There was some incident at
the crossing of the Couesnon (the boundary river between Normandy and
Brittany) which evidently vividly impressed contemporaries and which further
emphasized the now intimate and personal bond between Harold and the
Norman court.</p>

<p class='c006'>The river was forded. Men and horses got caught in the quicksands, and
in some fashion it was Harold and his men who saved those who were in peril.
It is worth pointing out in this connection that there was a bridge at Pontorson,
within a few miles of the mouth; why that bridge was not used suggests
an interesting conjecture. Perhaps the enemy held it, and William took his
force round by the seashore to the north in order to outflank the position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Conan of Brittany fell back on Dol, and then back again from Dol to
Rennes. In the representation of the retreat from Dol you have a man
sliding down a rope from the walls, which may be the memory of some incident,
or more probably a conventional mark of haste. I presume a retreat
upon Rennes, though the only proof of it is the single word “Rednes” and
the conventional drawing to represent the town. At any rate, the “hub of
the campaign” was at Dinant; the main fight was round the walls of that town,
and Conan is represented in the Tapestry as surrendering it. He “offers the
keys to William” in the inscription upon this panel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the very little documentary evidence we have goes to show that this
is legend rather than history, and further suggests the comparative lateness of
the Tapestry, for William of Poitiers tells us that the expedition was on the
whole unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c006'>These ten panels of the Breton Expedition (which I desire once more to
point out as capital in the whole story—as told in the Bayeux Tapestry) end
with a short and simple but critical incident, and that is the giving of arms to
Harold by William. The thing was already a ritual and the mention of
nothing could have more struck the men of the twelfth century with the
closeness of the personal tie between William and Harold, which all this part
of the Tapestry is designed to bring into relief. It is symbolised in the 26th
panel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next two panels (<a href='#i27'>27</a> and <a href='#i28'>28</a>) represent what is in popular history
the pivot of the whole story, Harold’s oath. It is, of course, the chief single
event in the story of what the Norman writers regard as his treason. Note
first that the scene is Bayeux. That is important, both because it explains
why this favourite town of William’s should also be the custodian of the
document before us, and because it again refers us to Wace and the <i>Roman
de Rou</i>. Wace is the only author, I believe, who puts down Bayeux as the
scene of Harold’s oath. I will give the words from the <i>Roman de Rou</i> that
the reader may judge:</p>

<p class='c006'>“That he (Harold) would give up to him (William) England when the
King Edward should die, and that he (Harold) should take to wife, if he
willed, a daughter that he (William) had. This, if he would, he should swear.
William ... summoned a Parliament<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> at Bayeux <i>as people say</i>,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>William is clothed in all the ritual garments of his authority, garments
which were for the rulers of that day almost hierarchic and priestly; he is
seated upon a throne, and everything is done by the artist to bring out the
solemnity of the occasion. Harold swears with a hand upon either reliquary
set upon two neighbouring altars for the purpose of the oath. It is true that
the inscription upon the Tapestry tells us nothing of what he is promising
upon oath, but we are quite safe in presuming that the story follows Wace
and that he is promising the crown of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is, of course, the chief matter of historical dispute in the whole business
whether Harold <i>did</i> make that promise or no.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the next two panels (<a href='#i29'>29</a>, <a href='#i30'>30</a>) Harold crosses the sea, touches English
land, and comes again into the presence of his king, Edward. The episodes are
not very striking. Perhaps the most remarkable is the conventional building
with a sort of pier thrust out into the sea, from which a look-out man watches
for the fleet and from the windows of which its arrival is also watched.
This building makes the division between the first and second of the panels.
It is remarkable that we have no written evidence of this interview between
Harold and Edward immediately following his landing; but it must have
taken place, and evidently contemporaries took it for granted.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next two panels (<a href='#i31'>31</a> and <a href='#i32'>32</a>) are a very curious instance of that
reversing of the historical order by the Tapestry, of which we have already
seen a minor example in the case of the messengers sent by William to Guy
of Ponthieu. What the artist desired to do was to tell, as a separate little
story, the death and burial of Edward; <i>but he conceived of it as an episode
running from right to left</i>, and the result is that, in the order of the Tapestry,
we have the burial actually coming <i>before</i> the death. Take the two panels
separately, read them from right to left, and you get a consecutive story;
Edward upon his death-bed, in the upper part of the canvas, is speaking his
last words to his lieges with the women and the tonsured priests about him.
In the lower part he is represented dead. Then, in the second part, to the
left, you have the body carried to Westminster Abbey, with acolytes ringing
bells and a retinue of tonsured priests. Perhaps the hand appearing from
heaven above Westminster Abbey is designed to indicate the sanctity of the
king. Nowhere does the Tapestry follow Wace more closely than in these
episodes, and even if we had no other evidence to guide us this portion of
the Tapestry alone would be almost sufficient to establish the connection
between the poem and the embroidery.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>34</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then comes the turning-point in the story, as in the series of pictures, and
it has been designed to come not quite half way in that series (the <a href='#i34'>34th</a> out of
76 panels). Harold is offered the crown of England: accepts it, and appears
enthroned and in full regalia. To the left you have two messengers holding
the typical battle-axe of the Saxon army, and a third messenger pointing
towards the death-bed of Edward<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a> with his right hand, and with his left
holding forth the crown. Next you have the same symbolism completed
with the picture of Harold enthroned as a king. The early
Middle Ages were careful to an extreme of their conventions, which
were centuries old and which linked them with Rome. To distinguish
by conventional signs between a king and a man who might be an actual
ruler but not king, to distinguish the various rituals of various decisive
ceremonies, the various accoutrements and the rest, was with them as strict
a matter as spelling is with us—I could not put it more strongly. When,
therefore, Harold is represented with the orb and cross, the sceptre and the
crown, and the long vesture of royalty, seated on the high throne, and
presented with the temporal sword, that picture is equivalent to what some
long emphatic statement would be in modern times that such and such a
man had committed himself to such and such a political action. It means
“See here! Harold did really seize the throne!” Scholars have made some
play over the presence of Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in this
panel. I may briefly put before the reader what I make of this figure. In the
first place, it is a divergence from Wace, who does not mention Stigand. In
the second place, it shows Stigand’s rôle as the Ecclesiastic responsible for the
crowning of Harold. In the third place, we must note that he is called
“The Archbishop.” Now I put all this together and I presume that when
the Tapestry was produced, about a generation later than the Conquest,
it was desired to make prominent the fact that a man held to be schismatic
was responsible for the Coronation, and that the same motives which caused
the making of Harold the villain of the piece throughout caused the author
to bring Stigand well forward. One or two critics have suggested that
Stigand’s irregular position would have prevented a foreign, or a later, artist
from calling him “Archbishop.” That seems to me unhistorical. True,
William of Malmesbury and every orthodox writer thought Stigand no
true Archbishop of Canterbury. He was a “false Archbishop” in their
language, but for all purposes of general description he was the Archbishop
all the same. Whether Stigand did, as a fact, crown Harold or not is
a matter for historical discussion; but it is certain that those who designed
the Bayeux Tapestry wanted it to be thought that Harold, a perjurer and
a traitor, had been crowned by a man who, in the heat of St. Gregory the
Seventh’s reformation of the Church, would be odious to public opinion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Between this panel and the next are a group of figures representing
“the populace,” who do homage to the new king. Then come two panels,
separated one from the other and dividing, as it were, the first half of the Epic
from the second. These two panels (<a href='#i35'>35</a> and <a href='#i36'>36</a>) give the comet, a figure
of Harold, and the arrival of an English ship upon Norman land.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was just after Low Sunday of the year 1066, on the Tuesday, I think,
that a great comet was seen in France and England. Modern science has
affected to regard it as Halley’s Comet, which it may possibly have been—but
modern science should remember that the variation of these bodies, and the
confusion of our evidence upon their movements in the remote past, gives
no one a right to certitude in such a matter. Nor is it of the least
importance. So far as we can fix a date, 25th April 1066 seems to have
been the moment when this star was first seen. At any rate, it was an
apparition which vastly moved the opinion of Europe at the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>What the artist meant by the episode with the single word “Harold”
does not seem to me doubtful. You have there the conventional marks of
the palace, the king in the full garb of his kingship but partially armed; a
messenger, and beneath him the hull of ships. He is awaiting the advent of
the invaders. He knows that they will come.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <a href='#i36'>second panel</a> of this group represents the coming of an English ship
to Normandy, and beyond that we are told nothing. But we do get some
light upon this panel from Wace, who tells us that a ship came from England
with a special message to the duke—it must be presumed a private message
sent to him at his own orders informing him of the death of Edward and
of the usurpation (as William would regard it) of Harold. We have all
the conventional symbols of the landing of a ship, but in these it must be
specially noticed that few men are represented, and that there are no arms.
After this begins the action which completes the whole business: I mean
the building and arming of the invading fleet, the landing of the invaders,
and the victory that followed.</p>

the building and launching of the ships. In the first William orders the

<p class='c006'>Next you have conventional representations of men cutting down trees,
rinding off the bark, and making planks. Then you have the construction
of the vessels and the dragging of them to the sea from the slips. It is
remarkable how little the artist has attempted to symbolise the implements of
this industry; the adze and the axe are all that he gives us. The hammer is
not recognisable, nor the nail, nor any other thing in the construction of the
boats. Following these three you get the provisioning of the fleet, and in
this long panel, or rather two panels undivided (<a href='#i41'>41</a> and <a href='#i42'>42</a>) we must closely
watch the details, for they are of great historical interest. There you will see
the servants bringing on board the swords in their scabbards, the lances tied
on to wagons, which also bear barrels of wine; over one man’s shoulder a
wine skin, over another’s a small barrel, and, borne upon poles, which bear their
weight and stretch them out, the heavy coats of mail for the knights. These
panels ended, you have the sailing of the fleet, monotonous and undivided,
covering what may be called four panels (<a href='#i43'>43</a>, <a href='#i44'>44</a>, <a href='#i45'>45</a>, and <a href='#i46'>46</a>), though all are
continuous. In these the draughtsman has concerned himself to insist upon
the number of horses that were carried, and upon little more. But at the
end of the inscription you have that piece of historical documentary evidence,
“And he came to Pevensey” (it is written just above the last of the four
foremost ships proceeding to disembarkation: the ship with the cross upon
its mast). The size of the transport, the great number of the ships, has
evidently impressed the artist, and he has tried to symbolise it. You get
exactly the same thing in Wace: “I have heard it told to my father that
there were 700 ships less four.” Then, again, the word Pevensey comes into
the <i>Roman de Rou</i>, though spelt “Penevesal” in that document.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the next panel (<a href='#i47'>47</a>), which is the disembarkation, the horses are again
insisted upon, and one curious point which I would remark, the un-stepping
of the mast. There are not a few descriptions in the later Dark Ages and the
early Middle Ages which lead us to believe that the mast of their small
craft was not fixed: for instance, the Danes going up river above London
Bridge. Let me repeat again, at the risk of tedium, that the episode of the
disembarkation of horses, which the men of the time seem to have been particularly
struck by, makes the Tapestry follow Wace. Once landed, the army in
the next panel (<a href='#i48'>48</a>) fully accoutred—or rather patrols of it—rides out to forage,
and you get as a sequel (in <a href='#i49'>49</a>) the raiding of houses, the slaughtering of cattle
and of sheep, the commandeering of horses; and next again (in <a href='#i50'>50</a>) you have
the preparing of a meal, and it is to be remarked how minute are the details
here compared with the vagueness of detail in the building of the ships.
Look, for instance, at the little stove of charcoal on which one of the cooks
is preparing the meat, and the spits with their roasted pieces, and see how the
draughtsman—whoever he was—knew more of courts than of artisans. And
the feast itself, which follows, is interesting as showing a table laid out in
continuity with classic custom, served from the inside of its horse-shoe or
oblong. In the inscription, though hardly to be discerned upon the Tapestry,
we have the benediction of the meats by the bishop—and the bishop should
mean Odo. But we have, I believe, no MSS. authority for that little incident
at all. The bishop is probably brought in here for the purpose of the next
scene, where he sits with his brother, Duke William, and with his other
brother, Robert, making council. The symbolism of the three figures is
obvious; the portraiture of William reappears, the unarmed priest upon the
left, the vassal brother upon the right making ready to draw the sword. In
the next panel (<a href='#i52'>52</a>) there is given the throwing up of earthworks for a
fortified camp at Hastings (the spade is half warfare), and here notice the
figure of Robert of Eu, for it exactly follows the account of Wace. The
figure holds the lance, and in command of the building of the camp is the
man whom the <i>Roman de Rou</i> speaks of as commanding the same work.</p>

<p class='c006'>With this panel the preliminaries of the action may be said to end, and
the advance towards the battle itself to begin. There are two incidents in
the next panel introducing that advance: one in which a messenger from
Harold reaches William (whose portrait is again clearly marked), another in
which the act of war begins with the burning of a house.</p>

<div id='i53'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i53.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>53</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Wace gives us the story of a friendly baron, whose name he did not know,
but who came and warned William of Harold’s movements. As to the
burning of the house, there has been a great deal of guesswork about it. I
believe it means no more than a bit of conventional symbolism that the war
has begun in earnest. To these two incidents in panel <a href='#i53'>53</a> succeed the feats of
arms which take up the remaining part of the Tapestry, and which I will treat
as a whole.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>54</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This last portion of the document consists in twenty-two panels, from the
54th to the 75th inclusive. In the first you have the conventional representation
of a knight fully armed representing the whole body as it were, and
riding out from Hastings on the morning of that October day which by
sunset had determined the fate of England.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been said by more than one modern English writer that the soldier
thus pictured is William himself, and consequently that the horse is that
Spanish horse which Alphonso had given William, and that its leader is
William’s old liegeman, Walter Giffard, who had brought it back with him
from Spain.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this—like such masses of Freeman!—is not only conjecture, it is also
false conjecture. Wherever William appears he is called William, and it is
unthinkable under the conditions of the time that his figure should be given
under the general name “knights.” Nor is the conventional figure leading
forward the stallion an old man; he is, if anything, on the young side.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will not here repeat what I have said elsewhere with regard to the
accoutrement of the knight, though it bears out in this particular panel very
strongly the conclusions of the Introduction as to the age of the document.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next two panels (<a href='#i55'>55</a> and <a href='#i56'>56</a>) are very interesting because they show
by what conventions the artist expresses the act of deployment. As long as
the cavalry are marching in column of route he puts each figure only slightly
overlapping the next, and suggests a walking space for the mounts; to express
deployment or formation into a broad column of attack, as he has not
the mastery of perspective, he puts the horses at the gallop and separates
them much further one from the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next point of interest in these panels is the personality of William
bearing not a sword or lance, but a staff of authority or mace; while behind
him is a figure bearing a sceptre, and it is only behind him again that you have
anything resembling the consecrated banner of the chroniclers. Here there
is a conflict between the Tapestry and Wace, as well as a divergence between
them, which shows (like the episode of the Breton War) that though our
document is largely based upon Wace, it must also have other sources. For
in the poem the consecrated banner is sent on before the host by William, and
that indeed is what one would expect; while the interrogation of one Vital by
William as to the results of his scouting, though it seems to have been an
incident that struck some contemporary or other vividly, is not found in any of
the chronicles. Who Vital was there is no sort of evidence to tell us. It
was a name known in Normandy. It occurs on a charter of William’s brother
in the list of witnesses, and again in Doomsday under the same lord. This
Vital of the Tapestry points in the direction of the scouts (who appear as conventional
figures in the <a href='#i58'>58th</a> panel), and there is here a little piece of realism
which is of great interest to those who have studied the field. It will be
observed that these scouts are represented as standing upon the summit and
the hither slopes of a hill while on the farther slope you have trees conventionally
represented. This hill, from which the scouts caught sight of
Harold’s army (which had marched up the day before and taken position
after that splendid advance from London—one of the most rapid in history)
was the hill now known as Telham Hill. The ridge on which Telham farm
stands was the summit beyond which the scouts did not advance, and the
wood on the slope immediately below is the wood represented in this panel.
In the next panel (<a href='#i59'>59</a>), as the inscription tells us, the converse is going on in
Harold’s case, and his scouts (represented as being on foot) come to tell
Harold, who is mounted, that they have established contact with the enemy.
The <a href='#i60'>60th</a> panel stands for the speech William made to his troops before the
battle. Most of the chronicles mention this episode, and Wace in particular.
You get again, in the next panel, the deployment suggested as before, and
then a group of four panels (<a href='#i62'>62</a>–<a href='#i65'>65</a> inclusive) bearing no inscription (the
words above them being no more than the continuation of the legend above
William’s speech: “That they should prepare themselves for battle against
the English army both courageously and with art”). And these four panels
are the effort of the artist, with such means as he had at his disposal, to give
some conception of the order of battle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we know what that order was. There were three columns of attack,
consisting of the fully armed and mounted knights. That on the left was
composed of the Bretons in the main, and had the duty of charging over
the space now occupied by, or neighbouring to, the pond in Battle Abbey
park. That on the left, which was to charge the steepest part of the hill,
was to cross the ground on which the station has been built in modern times;
it was a column mainly French and led by Roger of Montmorency. The
central column, which was to take the sharp hill between the two others,
was composed mainly of Normans and was led by William himself. Upon
the jutting promontory of the height which these three columns were to
attack, stood the Saxons on foot, depending largely upon the axe as a
defensive weapon, but also upon the throwing-spear or javelin, and to some
extent upon the sword. In front of the attacking army was scattered in
open order a line of archers, whose function was the permanent service of
the missile weapon, to wit, to shake the enemy’s infantry, upon which, so
shaken, the cavalry should charge.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Now all this the artist has attempted to represent. You have the attack
represented both to the right and to the left and falling upon a body which
faces two fronts; this is to symbolise the convergence of the three columns
upon the semicircular front of the Saxon position upon Battle Hill. No
particular figures are given; not even Harold is to be distinguished. Some
critics too ingenious have discovered in the head of the Norman charge the
person of Taillefer, “Iron-shear,” who certainly rode out before the army
singing his song of Roncesvalles and tossing his sword (or by another account,
his lance) into the air. There is nothing of this in the Tapestry.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next two panels (<a href='#i66'>66</a> and <a href='#i67'>67</a>) give the death of the two brothers
of Harold. Apart from the introduction of the figures of these two princes,
Lewine and Gyrth, the interest of these panels also lies in the accoutrements.
Thus on four of the charging French knights you see the crossed garters
which bound the leg below the suit of mail, and in the hands of one of
the English you see the round shield with a boss, which will reappear in
the scene of the death of Harold. I would say tentatively and subject
to correction, that this symbolised something old-fashioned in the Saxon
accoutrement. In the border below, the same type of accoutrement, the
round shield with the boss, reappears twice among the dead bodies. Gyrth
and Lewine were standing near Harold, and one chronicle makes William
himself fell Gyrth with a blow of his mace, but there is nothing of this
in the embroidery. There is no figure armed with a mace and no mention
of William. The <a href='#i68'>68th</a> panel is the liveliest attempt the artist makes
anywhere to represent the heat of the attack. It speaks for itself in the
exaggerated catastrophes of the mounts and of their riders; but what should
be particularly noted is the representation of the Hill of Battle, the horse
stumbling at the approach of it and the defence by the Saxon footmen upon
the summit.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With the <a href='#i69'>69th</a> panel we approach the attempts in the latter part of the
Tapestry to introduce persons. This attempt has led to a considerable historical
controversy, for while some points in the portraiture are obvious, others,
as will be seen in a moment, lend themselves to discussion.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>First we have, in the <a href='#i69'>69th</a> panel itself, Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop,
William’s brother, with the characteristically French inscription, “Pueros
suos,” by way of saying “his men.” “Here Odo, the Bishop, holding a
stick, heartens his men,” or literally, “his children.” So the modern
French army term, “mes enfants” for “men.” All this is quite clear; but
the next panel (No. <a href='#i70'>70</a>) has led to the controversy of which I speak. Note
here three men at the charge. The first brandishes a sword, the second has a
mace or sceptre in his hand, and is lifting the nasal of his helm, and the third
holds a lance and pennon or, as the French then called it, a Gonfanon. Above
the group is written, “Here is Duke William.” It is fairly established that
Wace’s poem (which the panels of this part of the Tapestry follow with great
fidelity) is here abandoned by the artist and the account of Benoit de Saint
More is followed. The incident is, of course, that of William showing his
face to his followers when it was feared he had fallen. Further, the first
figure carrying the pennon is certainly intended for Eustace of Boulogne.
Above his head, in one of the few fragments that have suffered mutilation, is
the beginning and ending of the word Eustatius (E——TIUS); while the
clear writing of the inscription round the central figure and the obvious
reference to the passage in Benoit de Saint More, coupled with the fact that
the central figure bears a mace or sceptre, not a sword, leave no doubt that it is
William that is intended. It is worth remembering in connection with the
date of the Tapestry that the emphasizing of the part which Eustace of
Boulogne played in the battle is peculiar to the twelfth-century chroniclers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next three panels are bringing the battle to an end. “Here,” says
the inscription, “the French fight and slay those who were with Harold.”
The number of armorial shields, and their presence even, on the Saxon side is
noteworthy, and the reappearance of the round shield with the boss in the
border; further, that the archers have at last got home, is indicated in the
arrows that have struck the shields, and in the full quivers of the border. The
stripping of the bodies of the slain by the camp followers is equally indicative
of the stage the fight has reached; and in the next panel (the <a href='#i74'>74th</a>) you have
one of the last episodes, the death of Harold himself. Harold is introduced
twice: first, standing near his standard pulling from his face the arrow that
has struck it; next, cut down by a mounted horseman, who strikes him on
the thigh with his sword. That exactly follows Wace point for point, for his
poem tells us first that Harold was struck in the eye by an arrow and that
he pulled it out, and that then one came, a knight, who struck him on the
thigh with a sword, wounding him to the bone; that at the same moment
the standard fell to earth, and that the men “then killed Harold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The last two panels (<a href='#i75'>75</a> and <a href='#i76'>76</a>) are the breaking of the ranks and the
flight. They need no comment save perhaps one note: the conventional
tree in the last panel may well enough stand for the wood of the Weald
which lay behind the Saxon position, and into which the rout pressed as
darkness fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been suggested that the Tapestry continued further than the point
at which it now ends, both because it is somewhat frayed at that end and
because in the description of another Tapestry (lost) the account of the day
following the battle is given.</p>

<p class='c006'>What seems to me to prove definitely that the Tapestry did end almost
exactly where its frayed edge terminates it to-day, is the fact that it was
exactly of a length to go round the nave of Bayeux Cathedral, and that the
measurements of the existing stuff correspond with that length.</p>
